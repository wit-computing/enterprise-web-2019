## Startup.

The three apps being developed over the coming weeks are:

+ Contact list
+ Phone Catalogue and 
+ Hacker News. 

This lab is focused on step one of the *Thinking in React* process - the development process recommended by the React design team (discussed in a later lectures). The step is titled: Build __a static version__ of the app. In subsequent labs we will add user interaction and routing.

Download and unzip [this zip][start]. We will use it as the starting point. It contains three skeletons apps, one for each of the above mentioned use case. The apps were generated with the `create-react-app` tool. We will use Git to keep a log of the work done in the labs over the coming weeks.
